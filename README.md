## TODO
* use fzf's keybindings for additional functionality (remove specific history item, clear history, etc) while keeping plugin's simplicity in mind ([issue](https://github.com/joshskidmore/zsh-fzf-history-search/issues/10))
* better documentation ([issue](https://github.com/joshskidmore/zsh-fzf-history-search/issues/11))
